Can you manage to take out time to pursue your career while caring for your family? Do you still dream to achieve the financial and personal goals that you have set for yourself? Do you wish to earn income and spend it on your priorities?

It is the 21st century, where having an equilibrium with work-life balance is not tough because with free internet and the opportunities to do work from home makes it easier so you should discriminate the things as per their priorities. You are well-educated to seek an opportunity and you can change your mentality from a graduate housewife to an earning graduate. No one can undervalue you if you have power in your hands and if you know you are on the right track. Your families will appreciate your hard work, your children will learn from you and they will get to know nothing is impossible if you are self-determined.

Some of the legendary housewives who brought a positive change in society are Mary Kom, Kalpana Chawala, Sania Mirza, and many more. These are the women who left their mark in history.  

If you think having a graduation degree is not enough. Let me tell you one thing if you have curiosity, interest, and consistency that is more than enough. This is the time where you can uplift your abilities, the amount that you earn as a fresher is considerable and it can build a better livelihood, support you financially so you can pay your daily bills and it will surely improve some areas of your lives. With rising inflation and costs of living, you need to enhance your household income to fulfill your dreams and goals. Women spend most of the time in house chores and receive no appreciation for a job. 

The question is how women will get an opportunity to earn at their convenience? The answer lies within you, your decision makes the difference. You are living in a generation where men and women are equal. It is rightly said — if you educate a man, you educate an individual. But if you educate a woman, you educate a nation. Remember, those days are gone when women always spent their time in the kitchen. You are capable of achieving more if you cross the limit lines that were drawn before you. Therefore let’s take a step towards a new world.

IT (Information Technology ) is very achievable. It requires a set of skills that you can learn without having a university degree in the IT field. It is far better than other industries because as technology evolves, the growth as well as improves. If you are looking into possibilities for a new career change, the IT industry might be at the top of your list.
